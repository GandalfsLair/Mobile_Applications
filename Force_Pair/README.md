WHAT IS FORCE_PAIR?

Based on the application of the same name from the TV series Person of Interest, the idea is that the user can effectively 'Blue Jack' another persons mobile device.

When the code is run, it gives a button marked 'FORCE PAIR' - hit the button and the code runs.

The code effectively makes a determination between 2 outcomes (Pass or Fail) and displays the appropriate screen

If successful, the program gives the user the option of;

Access Device    
Share Access     
Exit             

When the Access Device or Share Access buttons are pressed, a progress bar is displayed after which a message is displayed.

All messages can be amended within the code to display what the user needs.
