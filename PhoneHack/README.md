WHAT IS PHONEHACK.HTML?

This is code to be run on a mobile device. 

It is inspired by the Force Pair function as seen in the TV series Person of Interest, combined with some other tech bits from other films and shows.

HOW DOES IT WORK? WHAT DOES IT DO 'NARRATIVELY'?

Run the code on a mobile device
At the bottom of the screen should be a button marked 'INITIATE FORCE PAIR' - Hit this button.

This will trigger the program, with data scrolling up the screen.

The code essentially picks a random outcome as to whether the program succeeds or not. 

If successful, the program displays a bunch of data and displays some boxes.
One of these is to Reset the Application.
Another is to Upload to Store, which gives a progress bar and a message stating that the data has been save.
This does nothing, but the user can state that the data has been centrally saved.

If unsuccessful, the program displays a message saying that the 'hack' has been detected.

All the messages etc can be amended within the code.
